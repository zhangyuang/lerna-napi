ðŸš€ Fastest bcrypt in NodeJS

## Support matrix

|                   | node 10 | node12 | node14 |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ |
| Windows 64 latest | âœ“       | âœ“      | âœ“      |
| macOS latest      | âœ“       | âœ“      | âœ“      |
| Linux             | âœ“       | âœ“      | âœ“      |

## Usage

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_ROUND = 12

function hashSync(password: string | Buffer, round?: number): string
function hash(password: string | Buffer, round?: number): Promise<string>
function verifySync(password: string | Buffer, hash: string | Buffer): boolean
function verify(password: string | Buffer, hash: string | Buffer): Promise<boolean>
```
