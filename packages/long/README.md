### Why JS MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is 2^53 - 1

As IEEE754 says, double type variable has 1 sign, 11 exponent, 52 fractionã€‚Due to Number 1 is the value beginning default, so the exponent max value is 53. why MAX_SAFE_INTEGER is 2^53 - 1 because if number is more than 2^53 such as 2^53 and 2^53 + 1 whose fraction will be same.
